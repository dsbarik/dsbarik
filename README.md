## Projects

### LLM-Based Reranking Framework
- Architected a hybrid scoring system combining LLM NLL scores, Sentence-BERT embeddings, and Bayesian priors, improving **P@3 by 31%** and **P@5 by 49%**.
- Addressed token-limit constraints via per-item prompting, enabling scalable processing of large item catalogs.
- Built an automated evaluation pipeline to monitor precision metrics across diverse user profiles.

### RAG Research Assistant
- Built a production-style local RAG pipeline using Ollama and ChromaDB for querying multiple PDFs while preserving data privacy.
- Designed a modular document service syncing ChromaDB with a SQLModel/SQLite backend for real-time indexing and full document cleanup.
- Implemented fallback retrieval logic when no relevant context is found.
- Developed an interactive Gradio UI with dynamic document management and cleanup.
